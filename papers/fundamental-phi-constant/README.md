* Abstract

I demonstrate that the golden ratio:

\Phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}

is not merely a geometric constant but a fundamental physical constant embedded directly
in thermodynamics, quantum statistics, black-body radiation, and resonant field theory.

By inserting the logarithmic-spiral identity

e^{2\pi \alpha_\Phi} = \Phi,\qquad \alpha_\Phi = \frac{\ln \Phi}{2\pi},

into the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, I show that

- the Boltzmann constant k_B,

- the Stefan–Boltzmann constant \sigma,

- and the temperature–frequency relation f = (k_B/h)T
	​
all become derived quantities governed by Φ-spiral geometry.

This establishes Φ as a universal invariant linking
exponential scaling (e),
circular periodicity (π),
and geometric self-similarity (Φ).
