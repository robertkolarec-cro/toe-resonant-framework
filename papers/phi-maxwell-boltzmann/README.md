* Abstract

In this paper I derive the resonant generalization of the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution,
embedding classical kinetic theory into the Φ–resonant operator framework.

By replacing the static temperature 𝑇 with the resonant effective temperature

T_{\text{eff}}(t) = \frac{T \Phi(t)}{\Phi(t)},

and introducing the universal damping constant

\alpha_\Phi = \frac{\ln \Phi}{2\pi},

the classical exponential law

e^{-\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}}

becomes a Φ–damped distribution consistent with the Φ–Fourier, Kolarec–Planck,
and Φ–Dirac–Lindblad frameworks.

I compute resonant expressions for:

- mean velocity,

- kinetic energy,

- pressure,

- sound speed,

- normalization,

- and physical interpretation,

and I show that Φ governs the thermodynamic spectrum from the quantum to the cosmological scale.
