Abstract

I prove that the golden ratio

$$\Phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$$

is the unique invariant of the infinite dihedral group $$D_\infty$$ acting on the plane via spiral–inversion transformations.

Let

$$S_\lambda(z) = \lambda e^{i\theta} z$$

denote a log-spiral dilation and the geometric inversion.

I show that the group generated by $$S_\lambda$$ and $$I$$ possesses a single nontrivial positive fixed point
under the combined action

$$I(S_\lambda(z)) = z$$,

and the only value of $$\lambda &gt; 0$$ or which this invariance is possible is:

$$\lambda = \Phi$$.

Thus the golden ratio arises as the fundamental invariant of spiral geometry, completing a deep connection between:

inversion symmetry,

log-spiral dilation,

Möbius transformations,

and dynamical symmetry of the infinite dihedral group $$D_\infty$$.

This group-theoretic property forms a core mathematical pillar of the Φ–resonant geometric framework.
