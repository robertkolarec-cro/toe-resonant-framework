- Abstract

I propose a Φ–resonant model for glueball formation based on the resonant geometric
identity that relates confinement, exponential damping, and harmonic field modes.

Using the universal Φ–damping constant

$$\alpha_\Phi = \frac{\ln \Phi}{2\pi}$$ ,

I define a resonant operator

$$\mathcal{O}_\Phi = -\alpha_\Phi \frac{d}{dt} + \Phi^{-1}$$,

and show that its eigenvalues align with expected glueball mass ratios in QCD,
suggesting a geometric origin for confinement.

The Φ–spiral symmetry generates:

harmonic quantization of mass states,

exponential damping in gluon field modes,

and a topological bridge between classical SU(3) confinement and resonant geometry.

This provides a conceptual and semi-quantitative explanation of glueball spectra
in terms of the Φ–resonant operator and spiral harmonic analysis.
