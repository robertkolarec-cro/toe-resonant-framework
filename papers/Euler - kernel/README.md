* Abstract
I demonstrate that Euler’s number *e* constitutes the intrinsic exponential kernel of
the golden ratio spiral. By enforcing the golden scaling condition  
`e^(2πκ) = Φ`,  
I derive the unique constant  
`αΦ = ln(Φ) / (2π)`,  
which unifies the constants *e*, *π* and *Φ* in a single resonant identity.  
This same αΦ governs the damping structure of the Φ–Fourier transform, the Kolarec–Planck operator, and multiple resonant physical laws found in the unified Φ-framework.
