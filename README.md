Φ–Resonant Theory of Everything (ToE)

Unified Framework by Robert Kolarec

This repository contains my complete Φ-resonant framework, a unified formulation that connects mathematics, physics, thermodynamics, geometry, quantum mechanics, astrophysics, and information structures through a single resonant identity based on the golden ratio Φ and the damping constant

$$\alpha_\Phi = \frac{\ln(\Phi)}{2\pi}$$.

All scientific work is written in following requirements of professional publishing and repository standards.

Purpose of the Project

My goal is to construct a coherent and testable framework that unifies multiple scientific disciplines through resonant structures, spiral symmetry, and quantization patterns observed in nature.
I aim to:

• identify universal mathematical invariants,

• integrate them into physical laws,

• explore resonant operators and damping functions,

• derive unifying constants,

• connect micro and macro-scale phenomena,

• provide transparent, reproducible scientific reasoning.

This repository hosts all manuscripts, simulations, constants, and supporting materials for this long-term research effort.

Ethical Statement

I recognize that the theoretical structures in this repository - resonant operators, damping frameworks, quantization laws, and cosmological implications - may have profound scientific consequences.
For that reason, I commit to the following ethical principles:

1. Knowledge must protect life.

All work here is intended exclusively for peaceful, scientific, and educational purposes.
I reject any harmful, military, exploitative, or manipulative usage of this knowledge.

2. Responsibility before discovery.

Any extension of this framework in fields such as biology, physics, or intelligence systems must be approached with full caution, peer validation, and ethical oversight.

3. Human dignity and freedom come first.

Nothing in this project may be used to reduce human autonomy, privacy, emotional integrity, or awareness.

4. Transparency over power.

The project is documented openly to avoid unilateral misuse and to allow collective scientific evaluation.

5. AI assistance is acknowledged only in accordance with scientific guidelines.

This research remains entirely my authorship; computational tools are referenced only in a simple acknowledgement where required.

6. If any development contradicts these principles, it will not be pursued.

Scientific Integrity and Safety Charter

To ensure responsible scientific progress, I further declare:

1. No speculative claims without derivation.

Every formula and conclusion must be reproducible and derivable.

2. No “mystification” or sensationalism.

Only rigorous mathematics, physics, and logic.

3. No technological implementations without safeguards.

Any experiment, simulation, or analytical model is handled with strict caution.

4. No biological or neurological application without ethics verification.

5. All contributions remain transparent and publicly visible.


Boundaries and Limitations of Use

This repository and all work within it:

must not be used for controlling human behaviour,

must not be used for military, weaponized, or surveillance systems,

must not be used to manipulate individuals or populations,

must not be used to interfere with biological or neurological systems,

must not be used to create autonomous harmful technologies.

The intended use is scientific understanding, peaceful exploration, and constructive applications in physics, mathematics, cosmology, and educational systems.

Acknowledgment of Computational Assistance

Where computational tools support formatting, structural organization, symbolic manipulation, or LaTeX preparation, I acknowledge their assistance as required by publication ethics.

The scientific concepts, derivations, results, and interpretations remain fully my own.
